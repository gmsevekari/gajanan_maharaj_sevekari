  "cardTitleJeevanParichay": "Introduction to Life",
  "cardContentJeevanParichay": "Sant Shree Gajanan Maharaj is one of Maharashtra’s most revered saints, known for his simplicity, divine presence, and miraculous acts. Through His incarnation, He illuminated the paths of numerous lives in His short but divine life of 32 years.\n\nThough His origins, birth, and lineage remain unknown, His impact is eternal. For 32 years, He graced the holy land of Shegaon, transforming it into a spiritual sanctuary. He was a \"Yogiraj\" in the truest sense, guiding countless souls through His miraculous Leelas (divine plays) and His mere presence, which radiated peace and absolute divinity.",
  "cardTitlePragatItihas": "History of Appearance",
  "cardContentPragatItihas": "Maharaj first appeared in Shegaon (in the Buldhana district of Maharashtra) on February 23, 1878 (Magh Vadya Saptami).\n\nMaharaj was seen as a young man with a radiant aura, sitting in the street and picking rice grains from discarded patravali (leaf plates) to eat. This act conveyed his first profound teaching: Annam Brahmeti (\"Food is Brahma/God\") — food should never be wasted and that for a realized soul, all matter is one. From the moment of his appearance, devotees recognized him as a spiritually awakened soul - “Yogiraj” and “Ansuya putra” (a child of divine detachment).",
  "cardTitleShikvan": "Teachings and Philosophy",
  "cardContentShikvan": "Maharaj is often associated with the Avadhut Sampradaya, characterized by saints who transcend material norms, express innocence and divine madness, and live in constant union with the Supreme.\n\nHis core philosophy is encapsulated in his constant chant: \"Gan Gan Ganat Bote.\" This mantra signifies that the individual soul (Jiva) is woven into the Universal Soul (Brahma), and God is present in every atom of existence.\n\nKey Pillars of His Teachings:\n* Annam Brahma: Respect for food as a divine entity.\n* Equality: He treated rich and poor, humans and animals, with equal love, rejecting caste and creed.\n* Karma Yoga: He emphasized doing one's duty without attachment to the fruit of actions.\n* Values: He guided devotees to follow the path of Bhakti (Devotion), Seva (Selfless Service), Sadachaar (Moral Conduct), and Tyag (Detachment).",
  "cardTitleSamadhi": "Samadhi Details",
  "cardContentSamadhi": "He spent 32 years in Shegaon, performing countless miracles (Leelas) to guide devotees toward the path of righteousness before taking Sanjeevan Samadhi — a state where a saint voluntarily exits the body while remaining conscious in the super-conscious state - on September 8, 1910 (Rishi Panchami).\n\nHis physical body rests in the Samadhi Mandir in Shegaon, but His spiritual presence is timeless. Before taking Samadhi, He assured His devotees: \"I am here, though I leave my body. Do not let your devotion waver, I will always be with you to protect you.\"\n\nToday, Shegaon is known as the \"Pandharpur of Vidarbha,\" where millions flock to experience the living presence of the Master.",
